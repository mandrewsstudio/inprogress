                    <h3>Care, Louder</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through our workshops with the OKC team, we discovered an essential tension at the heart of the
                        brand that needs to be communicated. Collaborative sessions with members across the globe —
                        including Brazil, Australia, UK, Kenya, Poland, USA, Canada, and more — helped us understand
                        what drives this passionate group of activists and organisers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being a movement made of parents and families, the concept of care runs through the whole
                        network. But care isn't always soft. Care is community, support, empathy — yes — but also
                        advocacy, solidarity and political pressure. From the beginning we established that the brand
                        needs to carve out a space that is both inviting and inspiring, warm and fierce, joyful and
                        forceful.

                    <h3>The Logo</h3>
                    <p>
                        We're particularly proud of this one. A logo that illustrates what's at the heart of the
                        organisation: our kids. We knew we wanted an iconic symbol that could defy translation, and show
                        the love, care and joy intrinsic to the movement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we realised the letters 'OKC', rotated 90°, resembled a child leaping over a horizon, we
                        knew this had to be the logo.

                    <p>
                        When it comes to a tagline, it pays to be direct. A simple statement of what we stand for — what
                        we believe in, what we are protecting, what we exist to amplify — the Power of Parents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also wanted to expand the definition, to include all parts of the global family, from the
                        father- and mother- figures that aren't related by blood, to those in the family and wider
                        community that play a pivotal role in nurturing and protecting the next generation.

                    <h3>A vibrant toolkit</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the most important aspects of a brand is that people need to be able to use it! The Our
                        Kids' Climate brand is a kit of parts that come together to form a vibrant, impactful whole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The toolkit includes a bright, distinctive colour palette, a bold, clear and characterful brand
                        font (Muoto by 205tf), and a range of textures and patterns that can be used to dial the volume
                        of communications up and down.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As always, we brought all these elements together, along with plenty of guidance and
                        inspiration, into an online brand guideline document and a range of editable templates for
                        things like presentations and social posts. The result is a brand that can speak loudly and
                        clearly, with joy and with urgency, and help realise the potential of parents and families and
                        their capacity to change the world.
