                <h2>What is a brand?</h2>
                <h3>Story, personality, and perception — a brand is more than you might think.</h3>
                <img src="../images/Logo-Load-Tiny.gif" style="width: 25px; text-align: center; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" />
                <p>
                    Most people these days have at least a passing familiarity with the idea of a brand. A big part of
                    how we consume culture is how we interact with brands, from social media accounts of multinational
                    corporations, to much-loved smaller brands that connect on a personal or social level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As culture has become more mediated through digital platforms and advertising, the public has become
                    more design literate, understanding that the way a piece of communication looks and sounds is formed
                    by a series of decisions. So when we ask, 'what is a brand?' a lot of people would reasonably
                    respond that a brand is a logo, a choice of fonts, a colour scheme and perhaps some graphic
                    elements.
                </p>
                <img src="images/1-Brand-Toolkit.jpg" />
                <p>
                    And they wouldn't be wrong. These are, generally speaking, the main elements that come together to
                    form the look and feel of a brand. But when we run our branding processes, we find it helps to zoom
                    out a bit.
                </p>
                <img src="images/2-Brand-Personality.jpg" />
                <p>
                    When we think of a brand we're familiar with, it's not unlike thinking of someone we know, or
                    perhaps a celebrity. In the same way that a friend or coworker can be funny, loud, and brash, or
                    reserved, thoughtful and quiet, so too can a brand. What we refer to as a 'brand' is how an
                    organisation is perceived by its audience. Take the obvious example, Apple: some people feel a real
                    affinity to the company and perceive it as cool, calm and beautifully simple, while others might see
                    them as lofty, somewhat pretentious and overhyped.
                </p>
                <img src="images/3-Brand-Story.jpg" />
                <p>
                    So really a brand is a narrative in someone's mind — a story inferred by the user, customer or
                    citizen. Let's look at another obvious example: Nike. Through their branding and communication, Nike
                    tells a story about the world, their customer and themselves. Nike presents the world as a challenge
                    to be bested, and their customers as ambitious go-getters. In this world, Nike provides the products
                    and the lifestyle that matches the perceived ambition of their audience, setting themselves up as
                    the cutting edge of technology, sportswear and culture.
                </p>
                <img src="images/4-Brand-Nike.jpg" />
                <p>
                    The work of branding is to take control of this narrative. To tell a compelling story about your own
                    organisation that rings true to your audience and motivates them to engage with your work. A story
                    will be formed whether or not you tell it, and the danger in neglecting your brand is that you will
                    have little-to-no control over how your organisation is perceived.
                </p>
                <h3>What is <u>your</u> brand?</h3>
                <p>
                    When it comes to thinking about your own brand, before considering things like your logo, fonts and
                    colours, think about perceptions. First, think about how *you* perceive your own organisation. Think
                    back to when you first joined, or when you started it: something attracted you to the work, the
                    team, the idea. So if your organisation was a friend or a coworker, how would you describe them? Are
                    they warm, caring and engaging, or straightforward, confident and cool? Are they funny? Playful?
                    Sociable? Thoughtful? Brainstorming a list of these words will help you get a feel for how you
                    perceive your brand and want your organisation to be perceived, and might even help you identify
                    what you want to change.
                </p>
                <img src="images/5-Quote.jpg" />
                <p>
                    This is the beginning of our rebrand process: taking our partners through their own perceptions and
                    starting to build a shared story of their organisation and their work. We talk about what motivates
                    people, why they are doing this work, what they want to achieve personally and collectively, who
                    they need to engage and how.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A branding process can (and should) be transformative for a campaigning organisation. It can get
                    your team on the same page, recognising their shared mission, vision and values, working with a
                    renewed confidence. For your audience, your brand can fill in the gaps between your work and their
                    needs and wants, and present your authentic personality for them to engage with. For your funders
                    and supporters, your brand can inspire confidence and help them celebrate and champion your work.
